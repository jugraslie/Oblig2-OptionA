    <h2> translation from wireframe to webpage</h2>
    <p class="reflection">
        The first part of this assignment was to create a wireframe, to plan what we wanted the page to look like.
        We had a clear vision on how we wanted it. We wanted a navigation bar at the top, where the left side
        linked to the images further down on the page, and the right side opened new pages with the reflection
        and the wireframes. In the middle of these we wanted the main heading of the page. We also wanted all
        of this on top of a picture.
        <br><br>
        We had no issues creating all the links and the heading. The difficult part was to put it on top of
        the picture. After trying different things, using the background-img property in CSS worked the best.
        <br><br>
        After this was to create the part with the photos. First I coded in the images in a regular way, but
        couldnâ€™t figure out how to put the text on top of the image. I tried many different ways and finding
        different codes in forums but nothing worked. After removing all my code and starting over I figured it
        out. Putting the text and the image together in a div, and putting the position of the image to relative
        and the text to absolute it worked. After this everything else was easy to figure out.
